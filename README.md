# About
This is the codebase for my file server which doubles down as a CDN (for [my website](https://www.smolik.xyz)). It has the following features:
* file upload/remove via http
* retrieving simple messages via http


# Run yourself
```
git clone https://github.com/dynamo58/smolik.xyz-CDN
cd smolik.xyz-CDN
```
Then move the contents of the folder into a PHP-enabled web server folder. If you've done that, you should be able to access the file via the port set by the web server.


# Future features
* None for now
