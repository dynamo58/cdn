# About
This is the codebase for my a file server which doubles down as a CDN (for [my website](https://www.smolik.xyz)). You can upload files via HTTP POST requests and also save simple messages into a DB.

# Run yourself
```
git clone https://github.com/dynamo58/smolik.xyz-CDN
cd smolik.xyz-CDN
```

Then move the contents of the folder into a PHP-enabled web server folder. If you've done that, you should be able to access the file via the port set by the web server.


# Future features
* Planning on implementing file deletion via a HTTP request
